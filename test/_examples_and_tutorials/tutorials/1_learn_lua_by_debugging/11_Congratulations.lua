    If you've got this far, you've learned enough lua to really get going
    There's some bits of lua you've not seen here - but you will be able to learn them when you want or when you see them

    The hardest thing is getting past that first hurdle - which you've done

    From here, just google anything you're not sure of, such as:
        "Lua Maths Library"
        "How to clamp value in lua"
    etc.

    And of course, feel free to check out the "examples" folder as it grows - for code snippets
        The best way to learn more, is just to keep making things and solving each problem when you come to it.


    Best of Luck,
    If you find coding interesting - don't dismiss this as "just a game". Most of us who do this professionally, started off doing this kind of thing.
