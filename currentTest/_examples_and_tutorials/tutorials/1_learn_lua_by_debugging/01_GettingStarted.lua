    WELCOME TO THE "LEARN BY EXAMPLE", STORMWORKS LUA TUTORIAL

    EACH FILE IS AN EXAMPLE LUA-BLOCK THAT YOU CAN RUN
    READ THROUGH THE CODE, LEARN FROM THE GREEN COMMENTS, AND EXPERIMENT WITH CHANGING THINGS

    THE BEST WAY TO LEARN, IS JUST BY DOING

    WORK THROUGH THE FILES IN ORDER
    HIT F6 IN EACH ONE TO SEE WHAT IT DOES, CHANGE IT, THEN RE-RUN IT ETC.

    IF SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DON'T STRESS - THE MORE CODE YOU SEE AND READ, THE MORE IT WILL MAKE SENSE
    DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING AT ONCE!
]]

-- Hit F6 to run this file!

debug.log("We'll be using this function to log messages to the DEBUG CONSOLE at the bottom of your VSCode screen")
debug.log("Notice how each line of this file is run one after another")

debug.log("Don't worry about remembering everything")

debug.log("Off you go, close the simulator and move on to step 2")


-- Tip:
--  Ever get lost and can't find your files
--  Just look on the far left bar, and select the "Explorer" tab (CTRL+SHIFT+E)
