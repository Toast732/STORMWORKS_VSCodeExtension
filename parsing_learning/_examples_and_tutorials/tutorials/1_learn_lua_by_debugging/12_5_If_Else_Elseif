-- F6 to run!

-- Another quick one, just to put it on your radar

a = 500

if a==5 then
    debug.log("For this to run, a must be 5")
elseif a==4 then
    debug.log("If A wasn't 5, we check this condition - was it 4? If so this runs")
elseif a < 0 then
    debug.log("If neither of the above ran, and a is less than 0 - this runs")
else
    debug.log("If none of the above ran - else runs instead.")
end

-- the reason for a separate note on this
-- is it's very easy to write something that LOOKS like an if,elseif,else - but is actually two if statements
-- if you do this, you'll get an error about "missing end" that's a pain to understand - so just want to save you the difficulty now.

--[[ THIS is the WRONG way:

if a == 5 then
    -- fine so far
else if a == 4 then
    -- THE SPACE BETWEEN ELSE AND IF MAKES A NEW IF STATEMENT, NOT AN ELSEIF
else

end
-- will get an error here, about "missing end"


this BAD way, actually is the same as writing:
if a == 5 then
    -- stuff
else
    if a == 4 then
        -- stuff
    end

--? missing end


Very easy typo to make, and can be really confusing to figure out.
